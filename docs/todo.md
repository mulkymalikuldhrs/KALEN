**Last Updated**: 2026-06-10

## Phase 0: Project Setup ✅ (Complete)

- [x] Initialize monorepo (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo)
- [x] Configure TypeScript strict mode across all packages
- [x] Create `@kalen/shared` types and utilities package
- [x] Create `@kalen/identity` package structure
- [x] Create `@kalen/mcp-gateway` package structure
- [x] Create `@kalen/a2a-router` package structure
- [x] Docker Compose for local development (14 services)
- [x] Traefik API gateway configuration
- [x] PostgreSQL + pgvector initialization
- [x] Redis, NATS, MinIO, Elasticsearch configs
- [x] Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack
- [x] LiveKit WebRTC SFU configuration
- [x] `.env.example` with all required variables
- [x] `.gitignore` for Node.js, Go, secrets, certs
- [x] LICENSE (AGPL-3.0)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (README, PRD, design, architecture, API, deployment, security, contributing, structure, changelog)

### Completed in Subsequent Tasks

- [x] Replace hash-based signing with real Ed25519 (`@noble/ed25519`) — **Task 1**
- [x] Write unit tests for all 4 library packages — **Task 5** (379 tests passing)
- [x] Fix `validatePublicKey()` base64url length bug (Math.ceil → Math.floor) — **Task 5**

### Known Issues (carried forward)

- **MCP tool handlers**: Built-in tools return structured responses but are not wired to actual services yet.
- **A2A task storage**: In-memory only. TypeORM entities defined but services use in-memory stores.
- **SSE transport**: Uses browser EventSource. Server-side needs `eventsource` npm package.
- **Challenge store**: In-memory only. Needs Redis backing.

- [ ] Write integration tests for WebAuthn flow (with real DB)
- [ ] Security audit: verify no private keys stored server-side
- [ ] Security audit: verify suffix enforcement is unbreakable

**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks (2-3 weeks remaining)
**Success Criteria**: A human can register with a passkey, an agent can be created with `(ai)` suffix, tokens are issued and verified correctly. — *Partially met: library code works, but end-to-end with real persistence not yet functional.*
